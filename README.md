## ERC-20 Token DApp

This project is a simple ERC-20 token smart contract, deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, along with a frontend decentralized application (DApp) that allows users to interact with the token contract. The DApp enables users to check balances, transfer tokens, and connect their wallets to the Ethereum network.

### Features
ERC-20 Token Standard Compliance: The smart contract follows the ERC-20 standard, implementing functions such as transfer, balanceOf, and totalSupply.

Wallet Integration: Users can connect their MetaMask wallet to interact with the smart contract.

Token Transfer: Users can transfer tokens to any valid Ethereum address.

Balance Check: Users can check the token balance of any Ethereum address.

### Prerequisites

Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed (https://nodejs.org/).

Truffle Suite: Truffle is required to compile, deploy, and test the smart contract (https://trufflesuite.com/).

MetaMask: For interacting with the DApp, you'll need the MetaMask browser extension (https://metamask.io/).

### Technologies Used

Solidity: For writing the ERC-20 smart contract.

Truffle: Development environment for smart contracts.

JavaScript: For the frontend of the DApp.

MetaMask: Wallet integration for Ethereum interaction.


### Installation

##### Clone the Repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ERC20-Token-DApp.git

##### Install Dependencies:
npm install

##### Compile the Smart Contract:
truffle compile

##### Deploy the Smart Contract:

Deploy the smart contract to a local blockchain (e.g., Ganache) or a testnet (e.g., Rinkeby).

truffle migrate --network <network_name>

##### Update Frontend with Contract Address:

After deployment, update the contractAddress variable in the frontend's JavaScript file (src/myToken.test.js) with your contractâ€™s deployed address.

### Usage


#### Run the Local Server:

##### Start a server to host the frontend of the DApp.
npm start


##### Open the DApp in Browser:
Open http://localhost:3000 to access the DApp interface.

##### Connect MetaMask:
Connect your MetaMask wallet by clicking the Connect Wallet button.

##### Interact with the Token:
Check Balance: Enter an Ethereum address to view the token balance.

##### Transfer Tokens: 
Enter the recipient address and the amount to transfer tokens.
