## ERC-20 Token DApp

This project is a simple ERC-20 token smart contract, deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, along with a frontend decentralized application (DApp) that allows users to interact with the token contract. The DApp enables users to check balances, transfer tokens, and connect their wallets to the Ethereum network.

### Features
ERC-20 Token Standard Compliance: The smart contract follows the ERC-20 standard, implementing functions such as transfer, balanceOf, and totalSupply.

Wallet Integration: Users can connect their MetaMask wallet to interact with the smart contract.

Token Transfer: Users can transfer tokens to any valid Ethereum address.

Balance Check: Users can check the token balance of any Ethereum address.

### Prerequisites

Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed (https://nodejs.org/).

Truffle Suite: Truffle is required to compile, deploy, and test the smart contract (https://trufflesuite.com/).

MetaMask: For interacting with the DApp, you'll need the MetaMask browser extension (https://metamask.io/).

### Technologies Used

Solidity: For writing the ERC-20 smart contract.

Truffle: Development environment for smart contracts.

JavaScript: For the frontend of the DApp.

MetaMask: Wallet integration for Ethereum interaction.
